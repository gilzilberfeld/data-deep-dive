# AgileTD 2025: Test Data Management Workshop

Welcome to the hands-on workshop project for the AgileTD 2025 Deep Dive on Test Data Management.

## Setup

This project uses `npm workspaces`. Setup should be simple and straightforward.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from the root directory:
   `npm install`

This single command will install everything needed for the test suite. 3. Install Playwright browsers:
`npx playwright install`

## Running the Tests

To run the entire flawed test suite, use the following command from the root directory:
`npm test`

To run a specific file (which you will do during the workshop):

```npm test tests\file_to_run.ts

Good luck, and have fun investigating!
```
