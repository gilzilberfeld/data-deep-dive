# AgileTD 2025: Test Data Management Workshop

Welcome to the hands-on workshop project for the AgileTD 2025 Deep Dive on Flaky Tests.

## Setup

The tests will not run! The application doesn't exist!

But if you want to avoid squiggly lines, run install.
The tests use Playwright, but they do not need browsers to run, since they don't really run against a real application.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from the root directory:
   `npm install`

Good luck, and have fun investigating!
